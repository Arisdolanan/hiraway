# Getting Started with hiraway HTML

hiraway HTML is a clean, minimal, and powerful admin template built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's perfect for quick prototyping and simple projects.

> **Disclaimer:**
> This project is the result of an experimental coding process (vibe coding x AI). All implementation is based solely on the frontend knowledge I currently possess. Use and modify freely!

---

## Prerequisites

**You do NOT need Node.js or npm** if you just want to use the HTML template. Simply open the `index.html` file in your browser.

**Optional:**
If you want a better development experience (auto-reload), install the Live Server extension in VS Code.

## How to Use

### Option 1: Open Directly in Browser (Easiest)

1. Go to the `hiraway/` folder
2. Double-click the `index.html` file (or drag it into your browser)

### Option 2: Use Live Server (Recommended for Development)

1. Install the Live Server extension in VS Code
2. Right-click on `index.html` in the `hiraway/` folder
3. Select "Open with Live Server"

---

### Development Mode

For a better development experience with hot-reloading and automatic CSS compilation, you can use the built-in npm scripts:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will:

- Install all dependencies needed for development
- Watch your CSS files for changes
- Automatically compile when changes are detected
- Provide source maps for debugging
- Enable live reloading

> **Note:** Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. Jalankan perintah di atas di direktori `hiraway/`.

---

### Building for Production

To build and minify assets for production deployment:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will:

- Compile and minify your CSS and JavaScript assets
- Optimize files for best performance
- Output ready-to-deploy assets in the appropriate folders

---

## Including CSS & JavaScript Assets

**Make sure the file paths match the folder structure!**

Add this in the `<head>` section of your HTML:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/styles/hiraway.min.css" />
```

Add this before the closing `</body>` tag:

```html
<script src="assets/js/hiraway.js"></script>
```

---

## Basic Customization

- To change colors, fonts, or layout, edit the CSS files in `assets/styles/` or modify the HTML files directly.
- You can add or remove components by copying code from the `components/` folder into your pages.
- For images and icons, use the files in `assets/images/`.

---

## Notes

- **Ignore any instructions about `npm run dev` or `npm run build`** unless you plan to customize the template using Tailwind CSS or advanced workflows.
- The `package.json` and `tailwind.config.js` files are only needed if you want to rebuild or customize the CSS with Tailwind.
